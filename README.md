## **🚀 OSLLM: Open-Source Large Language Model**
**OSLLM** is an open-source large language model designed for decentralized, community-driven AI training. It is capable of training from scratch, learning from user interactions, and running efficiently on consumer GPUs.  

---

### **📌 Features**
- **Train Your Own LLM**: Uses PyTorch-based transformer architecture.  
- **Custom Tokenizer**: Learns from scratch using a BPE tokenizer.  
- **Multi-GPU Support**: Automatically scales across multiple GPUs.  
- **Interactive Chat Mode**: Learns from user queries and saves responses for future training.  
- **Fully Open Source**: Designed for transparency, customization, and decentralized AI development.

## **🛠 Installation**
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Rusty0124/OSLLM.git
cd OSLLM
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. Then, install the required Python libraries:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### **GPU Acceleration (Optional)**
If you have an NVIDIA GPU, install the CUDA-enabled PyTorch version:
```sh
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```
---

## **🚀 Running OSLLM**
### **1️⃣ Start OSLLM**
Run the main script:
```sh
python app.py
```
### **2️⃣ Select an Option**
You'll see a menu like this:
```
🔥 OSLLM Main Menu 🔥
[1] Train OSLLM
[2] Exit
```
- **Enter `1`** to train the model from scratch.  
- **Enter `2`** to exit.  

---

## **🧠 Training OSLLM**
### **Start Training**
To train OSLLM, select **option 1** in the menu or run:
```sh
python app.py
```
- The model will automatically detect available **GPUs** for faster training.  
- **Tokenization and dataset preparation** will happen before training begins.  

### **Training Parameters**
| Parameter      | Default Value |
|---------------|--------------|
| Batch Size    | Auto-detected (based on GPU memory) |
| Vocabulary Size | 32,000 |
| Epochs        | 3 |
| Learning Rate | 5e-5 |

## **📄 Training Data**
OSLLM uses a **custom BPE tokenizer** trained on:
- Wikipedia dumps  
- Open-source text datasets  
- User-provided training data  

To add more training data, **place `.txt` files inside the `data/` folder**.

---

## **🐛 Troubleshooting**
### **1️⃣ Stuck After Tokenization?**
- Try reducing dataset size by editing **`preprocess_data()`** in `app.py`:
```python
dataset = dataset["train"].select(range(5000))  # Reduce for faster testing
```

### **2️⃣ CUDA Memory Issues?**
- Reduce **batch size** in `app.py`:
```python
BATCH_SIZE = 4  # Try lowering to avoid OOM errors
```
- Run training on **CPU** instead:
```sh
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="" python app.py
```

### **3️⃣ No Module Named ‘torch’?**
Make sure PyTorch is installed:
```sh
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```
